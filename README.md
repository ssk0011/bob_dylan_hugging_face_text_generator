# bob_dylan_hugging_face_text_generator

An exploration of recreating Bob Dylan-esque lyrics with Hugging Face's pre-trained Transformer neural network, from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cloudy17/bob-dylan-songs 

The model itself can be trained further since this was only done on my local machine. Plus, the corpus can be expanded to include other artists and poets. Some of this work was intially explored in an earlier project of mine: [custom-markov-text-generator](https://github.com/ssk0011/custom-markov-text-generator)

## Here's a sample (cleaned up to remove extra spaces/extra punctuation):

In a cosmic sort of way, I don’t know, what are you thinking’t doing here?<br>
There’s no one here to help<br>
I’m the one who has taken the place of all<br>
And I’m the one who was born on the bottom of the world<br>
The sun just set, it was just kind of a sad thing<br>
What did you do, you wonder, that you’d put up that wall and you made<br>
